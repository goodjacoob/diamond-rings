<p>Firstly because it is an imitation of those who are no good. The groom is expected to pay mahr to the bride and must be paid to her and not her guardians. In principal it is allowed for a man to plait his hair as it is confirmed that the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam did so. Its a tradition that has been adopted by the people with any religion background. Islamic Calligraphy Rings. If a person believes that it creates love between the spouses and that removing it and not wearing it affects the martial relationship then this is considered Shirk. Pin On Mr Mrs.</p>

<p>Islamic Calligraphy Rings. The prophet saw himself used rings also. This is an old culture which came from the earlier faraaena Pharaops of the ancient Egypt which held the view that wearing the wedding ring on the middle finger of the left hand has a bonding effect in keeping a love. If a Muslim wears a ring then he should not wear it on the index and middle fingers. And regarding any ornament or jewellery woman are allowed to wear whatever they want but men are restricted from wearing any type of jewellery including ring. Gold rings are prohibited for men because in Islam appearing as another sex is what makes gold haram for men.

<p>Its a tradition that has been adopted by the people with any religion background. This can be anything of value or money or ayats of quran and iron bracelets I believe one sahabi gave so sure if its a diamond ring and its the gift then so be it. Therefore wearing a wedding ring is equally forbidden for both men and women. I have heard that exchanging wedding rings in Islam is haram and is not a sunnah of the Prophet pbuh. Gold rings are prohibited for men because in Islam appearing as another sex is what makes gold haram for men. There are a couple of caveats as far as rings in general go as well as wedding rings.
