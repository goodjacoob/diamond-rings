Women are only permitted to wear finger rings made of silver and gold of any weight. Therefore you need to pay 1 per gram. Should the wife pay for her own Zakat.

<p>The majority of the scholars of the 4 schools of jurisprudence are in agreement that there is no Zakat due on any sort of precious stones such as diamond. In the Name of Allah the Most Gracious the Most Merciful. However this excludes jewellery in day-to-day use eg your wedding ring or necklace. Yes she should unless her husband offers to pay on her behalf and she gives him permission to pay. The wedding ring can be worn on the right hand or left hand but not on the forbidden fingers middle finger and index finger. They take zakah but their wedding ring or gold set is more than the value of nisab. Pin On Products.</p>

<p>Shaykh Abdul-Azeez Bin Baz Paying Az-Zakah to the sister. Spending on the poor and the needy are indeed from the allowable portals where zakah dues can be spent. However it is prohibited to wear it if it is made of white gold as described above or contains a significant amount of yellow gold. You take the value of your gold or silver and pay zakat on 25 of the value. Shaykh Abdul-Azeez Bin Baz Az-Zakah for a person who wants to get married. So the responsibility belongs to the wife.
