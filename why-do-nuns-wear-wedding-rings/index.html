<p>They commit their lives to Christ and hence marry him. Do nuns wear wedding rings. Here is an enjoyable question I received from a reader recently. Because in the west the left hand ring finger is for married people. Nuns wear wedding bands to signify their status as brides of Christ. The tradition of wearing romantic jewellery on the ring finger dates back to Ancient Egypt when it was believed that a vein called the vena amoris quite literally vein of love in Latin ran directly from the tip of that finger to the heart.

<p>1 History of the Rings. Before we discuss why they wear the ring lets know a bit more about the nuns. 1 History of the Rings. By definition nuns are not married - though their vows are of similar solemnity. The ring is a symbol of their lifelong commitment devotion and fidelity to Jesus. Traditionally a nun wears a wedding band to symbolize her marriage or fidelity to the Church. Pin On It S A Nun S Life.</p>
