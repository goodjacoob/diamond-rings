<p>Rings have symbolism beyond the wedding. A wedding ring or wedding band is a finger ring that indicates that its wearer is married. Traditional Catholic wedding readings come from both the old and new testaments which are nine and fourteen options respectively. So that those who wear them may remain entirely faithful to each other abide in peace and in your will. The groom gave a ring to his bride-to-be as a public mark that a formal contract of engagement had. Most Catholic countries like France and Italy also use the left hand to wear wedding rings.

Historical records suggest that this was simply a tradition and not linked to any religious convictions which explains why Catholicism has since adopted the ring wearing traditions of any country they are in. But citizens of some other Catholic-majority states like Austria and Poland in Central Europe wear it on. Take this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit. So in the Catholic tradition its not a sign of possessing each other. 27 Unique Engagement Rings That Will Make Her Happy Wedding Rings Unique Designer Engagement Rings Wedding Rings Vintage.</p>
