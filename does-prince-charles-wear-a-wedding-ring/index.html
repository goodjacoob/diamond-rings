<p>Perhaps Charles bought her one so they could match. William isnt the only royal who has chosen not to wear a band. Charles wore his wedding ring from Diana on his left hand alongside his signet ring which is engraved with his fleur-de-lys crest. There is a picture before his wedding with Lady Diana wearing his watch and ring while he played polo. It is said that Princess Diana loved signet rings and wore her own back around the late 80s.

<p>Prince Charles husband to Camilla does wear a wedding band but instead of wearing it on his ring finger he stacks his wedding band with a giant gold signet ring on his left pinky finger that. Its not his wedding ring although. Princes William and Philip do not wear rings. But that changed when. Perhaps Charles bought her one so they could match. As a symbol of their marriage Charles and Camilla exchanged wedding bands made of pure Welsh gold as is royal tradition. Pin On Kralovna.</p>
