<p>But traditionally it doesnt have to be worn all the time after the couple is married. During the ceremony the bride stands on the left if you are looking toward the altar from where guests are seated and the groom stands on the right both facing the officiant. Then each party will place the ring on the partners finger. The priest will bless the wedding rings with a prayer and a sprinkling of holy water. The wedding party should enter the ceremony venue in the following order with Partner 1s attendants on the left and Partner 2s attendants on the right when walking down the aisle together. It is traditional for brides to receive two rings the first is an engagement ring which symbolises a promise of marriage.

<p>The ring bearer and flower girl precede the bride down the aisle. Traditionally the ring bearer carries the wedding rings or decoys if theyre too little. Both of them are worn on your third finger of your left hand. A wedding ring or commonly referred to as a wedding band is then given during the wedding ceremony and this band is traditionally known. The wedding band which held the most meaning was worn at the bottom because it meant it was closer to the heart. But traditionally it doesnt have to be worn all the time after the couple is married.

<p>Traditionally when you already have both an engagement ring and a wedding ring they are both worn on the ring finger between the little and middle finger on the left hand and the wedding ring is worn first followed by the engagement ring above it. First well get the answer. Turns out there is a specific way you should be wearing your engagement and wedding rings. Wear the wedding ring first then the engagement ring followed by the eternity ring. Tradition dictates that once you are married you should wear your wedding ring first so it is closer to your heart and engagement ring second. Its a really crazy thing because the order of the Wedding Rings doesnt make any sense at all But well get to this in a minute. Pin On Anillos.</p>
